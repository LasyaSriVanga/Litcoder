# Problem Statement:
# You are given two integers, num and k. You need to find the minimum possible size of a set of positive integers with the following properties:
# Each integer in the set has the unit digit equal to k.
# The sum of all the integers in the set equals num.
# If such a set exists, return its minimum size. Otherwise, if no set satisfies the conditions, return -1.

# Note: The set can contain multiple instances of the same integer, and if the set is empty, its sum is considered to be 0. The unit digit of a number 
# refers to its rightmost digit. Consider the input:

# num = 58 k = 9
# The function should return 2 because there exists a valid set with two positive integers, both having the units digit 9, and their sum is equal to 58.

# Important Note: Ensure that you save your solution before progressing to the next question and before submitting your answer.

# Exercise-1
# Input : 56 9
# Output : 4

# Exercise-2
# Input: 53
# Output: -1

num = int(input())
try:
    k = int(input())
except ValueError:
    k = 0

def minSetSize(num, k):
    if num == 0:
        return 0
    for i in range(1,10):
        if (i*k)<=num and (k*i)%10==num%10:
            return i
    return -1

print(minSetSize(num, k))
